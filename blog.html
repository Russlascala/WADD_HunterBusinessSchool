		<h2>Why I choose Web Development?</h2>
	</div>
	<div class="container">
		<p>Web Development is unique career that has many implications for the modern world. I choose to study web development because of its strong demand as well as its array of opportunities, applications, and opportunities. My first experience with web design was in college, I took a web design course where I learned about HTML and CSS. Then, 4 years later I found myself relearning and expanding on those techniques. After graduating from college, I started working for an online company shooting photos and listing and managing products on their online store. I found the inner workings of the ecommerce and website applications very interesting, this lead me to pursue web development. With my prior experience with photography, image manipulation, as well as online listing, I felt that web development would be a great fit for me enhance my technical skills.</p> 
		<p>I choose to study web development at Hunter Business School for many reasons. I already had a Bachelor’s degree so I did not want to go back to college. I felt that Hunter would be a great fit because of its efficiency in teaching you exactly what you want to know for web development. One thing I did not like about college is that I was learning stuff that was not necessarily relevant to the real world; also college did not prepare or help me with getting a job. Here at hunter, since classes started career development was a part of the process.</p> 
		<p>I choose to study web development because much of it you can learn online and you don’t need a degree to do it. Also the money for a web developer is a great bonus. The benefit of web development is the ability to expand into different areas of technology. This means that means growth is almost limitless as long as you will always be learning new things. For me, learning new things is important aspect to keeping motivated in your work. Another aspect I enjoy about web development is the potential to work for a company or potentially working as a freelancer. Lastly, the resources and community out there for web developers are very helpful and seems to be a great fit for me.</p>
